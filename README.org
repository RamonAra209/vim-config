* Wait a minute, why is this README written in Org-Mode?
Because I love emacs. This vim config was made out of necessity for work.
The goal is that this vim config will try to emulate most of my emacs workflow, hopefully.
[[https://github.com/RamonAra209/dot_emacs][Link to emacs config]]
* Quick-start
#+begin_src bash
  # Vim plug installation
  curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim

  # coc code completion 
  curl -sL install-node.vercel.app/lts | bash  # nodejs dependency
#+end_src

Once that's all out of the way, remember to:
1. ~:so~ within ~.vimrc~
2. ~:PlugInstall~
3. ~:CocInstall <language server>~
   1. e.g. ~:CocInstall coc-pyright~ & ~:CocInstall coc-rust-analyzer~
